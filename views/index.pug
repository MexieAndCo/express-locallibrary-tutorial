  Replaced the following code as instructed on
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Displaying_data/Home_page

//- 
  extends layout

  block content
    h1= title
    p Welcome to #{title}

  The view is straightforward. We extend the layout.pug base template, 
  overriding the block named 'content'. The first h1 heading will be 
  the escaped text for the title variable that was passed into the 
  render() functionâ€”note the use of the 'h1=' so that the following text 
  is treated as a JavaScript expression. We then include a paragraph 
  introducing the LocalLibrary.

  Under the Dynamic content heading we check whether the error variable 
  passed in from the render() function has been defined. If so, we note 
  the error. If not, we get and list the number of copies of each model 
  from the data variable.

  Note: We didn't escape the count values (i.e. we used the !{} syntax) 
  because the count values are calculated. If the information was 
  supplied by end-users then we'd escape the variable for display.

extends layout

block content
  h2= title
  p Welcome to #[em LocalLibrary], a very basic Express website developed as a tutorial example on the Mozilla Developer Network.

  h2 Dynamic content

  if error
    p Error getting dynamic content.
  else
    p The library has the following record counts:

    ul
      li #[strong Books:] !{data.book_count}
      li #[strong Copies:] !{data.book_instance_count}
      li #[strong Copies available:] !{data.book_instance_available_count}
      li #[strong Authors:] !{data.author_count}
      li #[strong Genres:] !{data.genre_count}
